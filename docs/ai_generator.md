# GenAI in Cloud Templates

GenAi is designed to streamline your creative process with advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. With the GenAi, you can create images and elements, which can then be seamlessly integrated into your designs. By combining these capabilities, you can create stunning, ready-to-use templates tailored to your needs.

## How to use GenAI

In the Template Cloud, in the left menu bar, you'll find a "GenAi" tab. Clicking on it will open your prompt area. Remember, the clearer and more descriptive your prompt is, the better the results you’ll get.

## Creating Assets with GenAI

1. Select  **"Asset"**

2. Enter your prompt in the text box

3. Select your desired aspect ratio from the dropdown menu

4. Click the **"Generate"** button.

Once ready, a preview window will display your image. If you're happy with it:

* Click **"Save Asset"**, give it a name, and it will be added to your Assets folder.

* You can now close the GenAi popup and continue your design process.

> If you’re not satisfied with the result, you can always regenerate it. Each time you click the "Generate" button, a new result will appear, replacing the current one.

## Creating Templates with GenAI

Templates are created by combining elements such as text, images, and shapes into a cohesive design.

1. Select the **"Element"**

2. In the prompt, describe the elements you'd like to add.

* For example, you can write something complex like:
"Create a head-to-head game template with two player images, a highlight image, sponsor logos, hashtags, a styled table for details, and space for the stadium name and participants’ names."

* Alternatively, you can request simpler elements like:
"Add a table with 3 rows and 4 columns at the bottom of the page."

3. Follow instruction below if you want to add an AI asset to the template and click “Generate Asset.” Note: this is optional and if you do not select “Generate Asset” the system will create a template with placeholders

4. Once ready, click the **"Generate"** button.

### Important to note:

* The platform will never delete your work. Any new layers created by the AI will be added on top of your existing layers.

* The platform will organize these layers based on their type and add them to your **Elements List** on the right-hand side.

* You can rename, delete, edit, or manage these layers just like any other layers in your design.

* Resolution is derived from the template resolution that can be changed via Resize.

### Adding customized assets to your template

If you want the AI to generate assets as part of your element check the **"Generate assets"** checkbox at the bottom of the prompt (This will result in additional credits used).

## What are credits and how do they work?

Credits are the platform's currency for using GenAi. Every time you generate an asset or an element, credits are deducted from your account. Managing your credits wisely allows you to maximize your use of the GenAi and unlock its full potential. If necessary, contact your Customer Success Manager to add more credits to your account. 

### Credits Usage

Under **Settings > Farm**, you can see the number of credits available for using GenAi (this option is available only to users with Admin or Manager roles).

* Generating an asset costs 1 credit.
* The number of credits required for an element option **depends on its complexity**. For more intricate elements that include multiple assets, additional credits will be deducted proportionally based on the number of assets generated.

> You can always check your credit balance under **Settings > Farm**.

## Where can I use GenAI?

Currently, GenAi is available within the Cloud Templates and in any platform where the Cloud Templates can be integrated, such as Engage Engine.
