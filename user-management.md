# User Management
When you open an account in Template Farm you are the owner, the admin and the only user in you account. Over time, you'll want to add more users to your account and grant them some or full access to your content.
You might want to share some templates with some users and other templates with other users. In Template Farm, you can create a whole eco-system of users that have different permissions over what they can do and what content
they are allowed to use. The goal is to keep your production workflow simple and organized for all users. This is especially important when you are dealing with a lot of users and a massive amount of content.

## Adding new members
Head to the the account settings and select the **Team** tab (or [click here](https://www.templatefarm.io/account/settings/users)). Click the **Add Member** button. A new popup will show asking you to enter
the new members email, assign their role (this can be modified later) and assign them to a group (optional). Ones you filled out the values, hit **Done**. An invitation email will be sent to the new members email inviting them to join
Template Farm. The new member will be added to the members list and you'll see their email only. Once the member signs up through the invitation link and add their info (like first and last name) the email of the member will be replaced with their first and last name.

> The invited member HAS to click the invitation link in the email! If they open an account directly in Template Farm without going through the invite link, they will not be added to your team in your account.
Instead they'll just create their own free account and will not be a part of your team or plan.

## Member roles
When inviting new members you'll be asked to chose the role of the member. In Template Farm the roles define what each member of the team can do, and what features each member has access to.
You can assign different roles to different members based on their function within your organization. You can always change the role of each member by clicking the **Settings** button in the users row.

### Editors
The editors will usually be content people. They will be focused more on the content that goes into the templates rather then the management of the Template Farm projects and account.
The Editors can:
* Access only projects that were shared with them by managers and admins
* Populate templates with content
* Preview templates
* Produce templates

The editors cannot:
* Manage the account settings
* Invite or manage other members
* Add or manage Farmers
* Share projects with other users
* Change project settings

### Managers
The managers are usually senior producers or project managers. They will are still focused on content but also on the final result that will be rendered and where would it eventually go.
The Managers can:
* Do everything that the editors can do
* See all available project (there is no need to share projects with managers since they see it all anyway)
* Share projects with other users
* Change the project settings

The managers cannot:
* Manage the account settings
* Invite or manage other members
* Add or manage Farmers

### Admins
The admins are usually more technical people, who will oversee the entire Template Farm infrastructure like shared folders, Farmers installation, AE instances, etc.
Admins can:
* Everything that the managers can do
* See all available projects (there is no need to share projects with admins since they see it all anyway)
* Invite, remove and manage roles of other members (with the exception of the owner)
* Add, remove and manage Farmers (including Clusters)

The admins cannot:
* Close the account
* Change billing settings

### Owner
The owner is the person that opened the account in Template Farm, that is the first member of the account. This role cannot be assigned to other members (only transferred). There can be only one owen per account at any given time.
The owner basically controls any aspect of the account. The owner can:
* Do everything that the admins can do
* Change the billing settings
* Upgrade the account
* Close the account

> The roles do not control what content the members will see. This done through sharing.

## User Groups
After adding members to your team, you can group them into user groups. The user group allows you to share content with more ease. For example let's say you have a folder with template for the evening news.
You also have 15 producers that works for the evening news. Rather than share the folder with 15 members one at a time. You can add all the members to a group called "Evening News" and share the folder with the group.
This approach is also useful if a member leaves the team. Removing the member from the group will un-share all content they have access to via the group. Members can be a part of more than one user group.

### Creating a group
To create a group, in the **Team** tab of the account settings, click the **Add Group** button (next to the **Add Member**). A new popup will show asking you to name the group and select the members for that group.
The members selection will auto complete based on the current members in your team. The new group will be added to the **Groups** tab.

### Adding and removing members
You can add and remove members from the group by either going to the settings of the member and add or remove the group you want for that member.
You can also go to the group settings and add or remove the member you want for that group.

# Content Management
When an After Effects project is saved in a watch folder, it will show up on line in a matter of seconds. As an admin or a manager, you'll be able to see the project in it's relative folder. In other words, admins and managers
see the folder structure in Template Farm exactly as it is in the watch folder. Editors have no access to content unless it was shared with them by admins or managers. So in order for Editors to start populating templates with content
someone needs to share something with them.

## Sharing content
In Template Farm, both projects and folders containing projects can be shared with other users. In order to share any content, hover your mouse of the content piece you wish to share (project or folder)
and click the share icon at the bottom right corner of the content thumbnail. A new popup will show asking you to fill the names of the recipients you want to share the content with. You can add individual members or user groups.
The names will auto-complete based on the available members and user groups. You can add multiple members and user groups. Once you are done adding all the recipients click **Share**. Now Editors will see the content you have shared once
they'll login to Template Farm.
